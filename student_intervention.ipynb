In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths : \n",
    "- It can handle very large feature dimention (even infinite dimension features using radial basis function). \n",
    "- Non-linear decision surfaces can be found using kernels (like polynomial, RBF).  \n",
    "- Using soft-margin, we can control overfitting. \n",
    "- Even with very large datasets, only a few support vectors are used for the seperating hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- Algorithmic complexity is high, it can take more time for training. \n",
    "- Another disadvantage is that choosing the right svm kernel can be quite difficult for non-linear decision surfaces. \n",
    "- Also multi-class SVMs are not straightforward to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate:\n",
    "- We have to select only yes/no for whether a candidate requires intervention.  \n",

    "I'd choose the SVM classifier model since it gives the best testing f1 score (which is an indication of how well the model generalizes). Even though the logistic regression is faster and gives a rather close f1 score compared to SVM, I'd go with SVM still because the training/prediction time is still very small in absolute numbers and when the number of training points increases, LR will have a problem with classifying points where P[Y|X] is close to 0.5. Also with SVM, we will be able to control overfitting nicely by using soft margin classifier.\n",

    "The SVM uses data that we already have about the students (i.e passed vs failed). If these data points are placed in space (assume 2-D space for now), then the SVM is trying to find a line that seperates the data points so that the 'passed' points fall on one side of the line and the 'failed' data points fall on the other side of the line. Of course there could be many lines that could seperate the data, and what SVM does is to find the line that is in the middle of the open space between these 2 sections of data. This is called as finding a seperating line(or hyperplace) with maximum margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all well if the data is linearly seperable in 2-D space; What if it is not? In this case, SVM tries to lift these points from 2-D to a much higher dimensional space and then tries to fit a hyperplane (instead of a line) so that the points are now seperated nicely by this hyperplane (a hyperplane is the equivalent of a line, but in higher dimensional space).\n",
